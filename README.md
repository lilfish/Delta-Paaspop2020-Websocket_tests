Websockets test git voor stress testing 

In this test I'm going to make a container for each language that I'm going to test. In each folder you'll find a folder of a websocket server name with in that a docker image and a websocket server.
The websocket servers I'm going to test are:

**Node js**
* Socket.Io
* uWebsockets with Typescript
* -

**Python**
* Simple websockets
* Tornado
* -
